# CriptoMersenne

On this project we implement (this cryptographic system)[https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/481.pdf] on Kotlin as an asignment for 
Introduction to Modern Cryptography (CC5301) Autum 2019 at University of Chile, examples of how to run the code and details on the
implementation can be found in (the project wiki)[https://github.com/BastyZ/CriptoMersenne/wiki].

If you want to contribute you can fork the code or add an _issue_, we'll be happy to hear from you!
